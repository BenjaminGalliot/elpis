# Elpis

Elpis is a pipeline of tools which language documentation workers with minimal computational experience can use to build their own speech models, using the Kaldi automatic speech recognition system.

The code is currently over at https://github.com/CoEDL/kaldi-helpers but will be moving here soon.

## Summer School 2018 workshop
