# Elpis (Automatic Transcription for Linguists)

## What is Elpis?

Elpis is a tool which allows language workers with minimal computational experience to build their own speech models 
for use in automatically transcribing audio. It relies on the [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org) automatic speech recognition 
(ASR) library. Kaldi is notorious for being difficult to build, use and navigate - even for trained computer scientists. 
The goal of Elpis is to expose the power of Kaldi to linguists and language workers by abstracting away much of the 
needless technical complexity.

Currently, the major component of Elpis is [kaldi_helpers](https://github.com/CoEDL/kaldi_helpers), a collection of 
Python and shell scripts designed to prepare data for use with Kaldi and convert between the various time-aligned 
transcription formats.

## How Does It Work?

Elpis uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), specifically an [Ubuntu Linux](https://www.ubuntu.com/) image to install
Kaldi and its (many) dependencies. It also installs [kaldi_helpers](https://github.com/CoEDL/kaldi_helpers) and the 
[Task](https://taskfile.org/#/) task runner. We have defined a number of tasks which automate many common workflows like
data preparation, model creation and inferring transcriptions for new files. You can read about these tasks: 
[here](https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki/tasks).

## How Do I Use It?

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki/Elpis-Step-By-Step-Guide) pages for usage instructions.

## Why Is It Called Elpis?

Elpis was the ancient Greek goddess of hope. For us Elpis represents our hope that one day no-one will have to suffer 
the trauma of interacting directly with the [Kaldi codebase](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi).
